# Assignment 2
This is my repository for Assignment 2 for CAP 4063

## Organization

I separated the 3 parts of the Assignment into different Unity scenes.

`part1.unity` has the solution to Part #1 of the assignment, which is a basic "Seek" behavior.

`part2.unity` uses the Unity NavMesh to implement A* pathfinding. Click once to place the player object (the skeleton), and then the second click will draw a line with the shortest path between the player and where you clicked.

`part3.unity` builds upons `part2` but makes it so the player will now actually follow the shortest path to the point you clicked.
